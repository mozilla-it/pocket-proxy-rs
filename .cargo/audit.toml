    # chrono has a rare data race that could theoretically lead to a segfault when a different
    # thread sets an environment variable at the same time as the local time is read â€“ see
    # https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/499 for details. We neither retrieve local
    # times in this project at any point, nor do we set environment variables, so we are not
    # affected by this. Currently, there is no version of chrono that is not affected by the
    # issue, but a fix is being worked on in https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/pull/677.
    # Older versions of the time crate are also affected by this issue. That crate occurs in
    # the dependency graph in two different versions. The affected older version only gets
    # pulled in as a dependency of chrono, see https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/553.
    # For the time being, I don't think we have any other option than ignoring these issues.
